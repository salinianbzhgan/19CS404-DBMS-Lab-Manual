# Experiment 3: DML Commands
NAME: SALINI A
REG NO:212223220091
## AIM
To study and implement DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands.

## THEORY

### 1. INSERT INTO
Used to add records into a relation.
These are three type of INSERT INTO queries which are as
A)Inserting a single record
**Syntax (Single Row):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES (value_1, value_2, ...);
```
**Syntax (Multiple Rows):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES
(value_1, value_2, ...),
(value_3, value_4, ...);
```
**Syntax (Insert from another table):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name SELECT * FROM other_table WHERE condition;
```
### 2. UPDATE
Used to modify records in a relation.
Syntax:
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```
### 3. DELETE
Used to delete records from a relation.
**Syntax (All rows):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
```
**Syntax (Specific condition):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### 4. SELECT
Used to retrieve records from a table.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Question 1**
--
-- Write a SQL statement to Update the reorder level to 20 where the quantity in stock is less than 10 and product category is 'Snacks' in the products table.

Products table

```sql

set reorder_lvl=20
where quantity<10 and category ='Snacks';
```

**Question 7**
---
--Write a SQL query to Delete customers with 'GRADE' 3 and whose 'CUST_NAME' contains the substring 'BBB', and 'PAYMENT_AMT' is greater than 2000

```sql
-- delete from customer
where grade= 3 
and cust_name like '%BBB%' 
and payment_amt>2000;
```

**Output:**

**Question 8**
---
-- Write a SQL query to Delete customers from 'customer' table where 'AGENT_CODE' is either 'A003' or 'A008'.


```sql
-- delete from customer
where agent_code IN('A003','A008');
```

**Output:**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/649e2c82-a669-4b95-b207-461aca128594)



**Question 9**
---
-- Write a SQL query to Delete customers from 'customer' table where 'CUST_CITY' is not 'New York' and 'OUTSTANDING_AMT' is greater than 5000.

```sql
-- DELETE FROM CUSTOMER
WHERE CUST_CITY != 'New York'
and outstanding_AMT >5000;
```

**Output:**

**Question 10**
---
-- Write a SQL query to delete a doctor from Doctors table whose Specialization is 'Pediatrics' and First name is 'Michael'.
